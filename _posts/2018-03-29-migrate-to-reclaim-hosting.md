<h4>Step One: Signing up for an Account</h4>
The first step will be to sign up for an account at Reclaim Hosting. <a href="https://portal.reclaimhosting.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;pid=2">This link</a> will take you directly to their Student/Individual Hosting plan option.
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">-If you already have a Top-Level domain (i.e. yourdomain.com) choose the <em>I will use my existing domain and update my nameservers</em> option.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">-If your current website content exists on a subdomain (i.e. yourdomain.stateu.org), select the <em>Register a New Domain </em>option.</p>
