The cPanel, or control panel, is your landing page for State University that lets you easily access and manage the files and applications of your account. Once logging into your account, you can see your active domains and personal account information at a glance.
<h4 id="applications">Applications</h4>
State University has four featured applications listed, but there are many, many more that can be utilized. Just click on <strong>All Applications</strong> in order to see what possibilities lie in wait for your domain! For more information about web applications, <a title="What Exactly is a Web Application?" href="https://www.stateu.org/docs/#what-exactly-is-a-web-application" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">click here</a>.

<h4 id="domains">Domains</h4>
The Domains section of cPanel allows you to manage your addon domains, <a href="https://www.stateu.org/docs/#setting-up-subdomains" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">subdomains</a>, aliases, and redirected domains. Additionally, you can use the Zone Editor to map different parts of your domain to other hosting environments.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-198" src="https://wpdocs.timowens.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/201910Domains.png" sizes="(max-width: 1364px) 100vw, 1364px" srcset="https://wpdocs.timowens.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/201910Domains.png 1364w, https://wpdocs.timowens.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/1_201910Domains-300x42.png 300w, https://wpdocs.timowens.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/1_201910Domains-768x107.png 768w, https://wpdocs.timowens.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/1_201910Domains-1024x143.png 1024w" alt="cPanel section for Domain management tools" width="1364" height="190" />
<ul>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Addon Domains</strong> act as second website with its own unique content. <strong>Please note</strong>, you are required to register the new domain name before you can host it. Reclaim Hosting, our hosting provider, <a href="https://portal.reclaimhosting.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;domain=register" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">offers a service</a> for this, although there are other domain registration companies if you’d prefer to look elsewhere.</li>
 	<li><strong>Subdomains</strong> act as a second website with its own unique content without having to register a new domain name. In general, you use your existing domain name and change the www to another relevant term. For example, student.stateu.org is a subdomain of stateu.org.</li>
 	<li><strong>Redirects</strong> map old domains to your existing domain.</li>
 	<li><strong>Aliases</strong> allow you to create additional domain names to be mapped to the current domain.</li>
 	<li><strong>Zone Editor </strong>handles DNS (Domain Name System)<strong> </strong>and allows you to see what’s happening behind the scenes when someone visits your website. For more information, see the “<a href="https://www.stateu.org/docs/#what-is-dns" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What is DNS?</a>” section of this documentation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="files">Files</h4>
Within files, you are able to manage and organize all the files on your domain. To truly see the capabilities of these tools – just click and explore!
