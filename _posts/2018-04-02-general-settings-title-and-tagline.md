Now that you have your WordPress installed and running, it's time to look at some basic settings for your site.
<ol>
 	<li class="vspace">The place that you will access the settings for your site is called the <strong>Dashboard</strong>, and it provides the starting point for accessing all of your sites dials and knobs.<img class="shadow alignnone wp-image-153 size-full" src="https://stateu.org/docs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019104.1-f.gif" alt="Screenshot of Wordpress dashboard" width="1245" height="1085" /></li>
 	<li class="vspace">The setting we will look at here is your blog “title” and “tagline”. It is located in <strong>Settings &gt; General</strong>. Once you're on the General Settings page, you can give your blog any <strong>title</strong> you want. You can also give your blog a <strong>tagline</strong>, which can be a short description of the blog.</li>
</ol>
When you change the Blog title and tagline, they will show up at the top of your site. Depending on what theme you use, the title and taglines will show up in various places. In the case of some themes, they might not show up at all depending on whether they allow custom configurations. We won't worry about that for now.

There are more settings on the General Settings page, such as setting the administrative email account, time zone, date format, etc. Change those to whatever is appropriate for your site and geographical location.
