Choosing your domain name is the first step in getting started with staking your claim on the web. Your domain name is a unique Web address (e.g. <em>yourname.stateu.org)</em> that can be used to build out your own digital presence. As you make your choice, there are a few considerations to keep in mind:

<strong>Your Domain Name Must Be Available</strong>: Domain names must be unique, which means in order for you to claim your own, you need to be sure that it is currently available (and not being used by anyone else or any company or organization). There are lots of tools to check on domain availability, and when you sign up on stateu.org, we’ll actually check the availability of your choice for you. If you’d like to spend some time thinking about your choice and checking availability before you actually sign-up, we recommend using <a href="https://www.whois.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">whois.com</a>.

<strong>Choose a Domain You Can Live With</strong>: You should choose a domain name that you feel you can live with for quite some time. <strong>You should pick something that you won't find embarrassing in the future. </strong>A good rule of thumb is to pick a domain that you would be comfortable putting on a future job application.

<strong>You May Wish to Include Your Name in Your Domain</strong>: There is no requirement that your domain reflects your specific identity in the form of your first and last name. However, choosing a domain name that includes your name may make it easier for you to achieve higher rankings in search engines when someone queries your real name.

<strong>Pick a Domain you Like</strong>: At the end of the day, your domain should reflect you. Pick a domain you like and are proud of. It can reflect your interests, sports you play, or your hobby. Or it could just be your name. The “right” domain for you is the one you're comfortable with.
