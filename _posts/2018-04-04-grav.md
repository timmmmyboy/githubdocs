<b>Grav</b> is a content management system (CMS) or, said another way, it’s an application to make websites. But differs from other CMSs like Drupal or WordPress in its underlying technology. While it’s a PHP app like those two, unlike them it does not have a database. All data is written directly to files rather than stored and retrieved from a database. This is known as a flat-file system and it can help with performance given numerous database calls can slow down sites.

<strong>Why and when would you use Grav?</strong> Grav should maybe be reserved for the technically-savvy user. It’s not that Grav is particularly difficult (every CMS has a learning curve) but rather it gets really interesting when you can integrate it into Github using the <a href="https://getgrav.org/blog/git-sync-plugin" data-versionurl="http://bavatuesdays.com/amber/cache/83689baa046b1bad2c7194c16ad5fd98/" data-versiondate="2018-03-25T18:15:45+00:00" data-amber-behavior="">Github Sync</a> plugin, which syncs everything on your Grav site to a Github repository for others to contribute to, clone, or fork. Grav also requires a familiarity with <a href="http://kirkstrobeck.github.io/whatismarkdown.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Markdown</a>, a lightweight Markup language, so that's something to be aware of as well.
