Your State University cPanel includes a File Manager that allows you to interact directly with the files stored in your web hosting account. This can be useful if you want to upload software that cannot be automatically installed via the Web Applications section of your cPanel, if you need to change the name or permissions of a file or group or files, or if you want to edit a plain text file. To access your files via the File Manager, use these steps:
<ol>
 	<li class="vspace">Login to stateu.org with your StateU username and password.

 	<li class="vspace">Once logged in, you'll be on the homepage of your cPanel. The easiest way to navigate your cPanel is by utilizing the search bar in the top right panel. Search <strong>File Manager</strong>. When you press enter, you will be automatically redirected to the File Manager.  You can also find the File Manager icon under the <strong>Files</strong> section.

 	<li class="vspace">On the left side of the “File Manager” window, you'll see a navigation menu containing the file structure of your web hosting account. More information about the contents of these files and folders can be found in the <a href="https://stateu.org/docs/uncategorized/file-structures-and-the-file-manager/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">File Structures and the File Manager</a> documentation article.
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-115" src="https://stateu.org/docs/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-03-30-at-12.39-PM.png" alt="" width="1108" height="561" /></li>
 	<li class="vspace">In the navigation menu, choose the <strong>public_html</strong> directory. This will take you directly to the folder that contains the files associated with your website(s). You'll notice your current location (the public_html folder) is bolded and highlighted in this menu. Click the [+] (expand) icon next to a folder to see what subfolders it contains, or click on the name of the folder to view all of its contents in the file browser on the right side of the page. You can also navigate through the folders in your account by double-clicking on them in the menu on the left side of your file manager.
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-116" src="https://stateu.org/docs/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-03-30-at-12.44-PM.png" alt="" width="969" height="466" /></li>
 	<li class="vspace">To select an item, click once on its icon in the file browser. You can also use the “Select All” button above the file browser, or your computer's keyboard shortcuts (Shift, Command, Control, etc), to select multiple items from this list.
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-117" src="https://stateu.org/docs/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-03-30-at-12.47-PM.png" alt="" width="972" height="441" /></li>
 	<li class="vspace">Depending on what you have selected, different options will be available to you in the action menu across the top of your file manager. For example, if you have selected a folder, you can <strong>rename</strong> it or <strong>Change Permissions</strong> on it.

 	<li class="vspace">If you know exactly what location you want to skip to within your web hosting account, you can type it into the box directly above the navigation menu and click <strong>Go</strong>.<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-118" src="https://stateu.org/docs/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-03-30-at-12.51-PM.png" alt="" width="1402" height="380" /></li>
 	<li class="vspace">Alternatively, if you know the exact name of the file or folder you are looking for, but not its location, you can use the <strong>Search</strong> box to find it.<img class="shadow alignnone wp-image-200 size-full" src="https://stateu.org/docs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019102.4-f-file-manager-search.gif" alt="screen shot to find file by name" width="1166" height="134" /></li>
