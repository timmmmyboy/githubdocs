 	<li class="vspace">To get started you'll need to login to your control panel (<a class="urlextern" title="https://stateu.org/dashboard" href="https://stateu.org/dashboard" rel="nofollow">https://stateu.org/dashboard</a>) using your State University username and password.<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-66" src="https://wpdocs.timowens.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/login.png" alt="" width="477" height="320" /></li>
 	<li class="vspace">Navigate to the Application section and select Scalar. You can also use the search function as well.<img class="shadow alignnone wp-image-345 size-full" src="https://wpdocs.timowens.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019104.3-scalar-installatron-icon.gif" alt="scalar installer icon" width="1151" height="284" /></li>
 	<li class="vspace">When you click on the Scalar icon, you will be taken to the Scalar information page. Click <strong>install this application</strong>.<img class="shadow alignnone wp-image-347 size-full" src="https://wpdocs.timowens.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019104.3-scalar-installatron-install.gif" alt="install Scalar" width="1525" height="546" /></li>
 	<li class="vspace">On the next page, fill in the different fields accordingly:
-Select the domain or sub-domain where you'd like your Scalar site to live. You can create a sub-domain by following directions in the section <a href="https://stateu.org/docs/uncategorized/setting-up-subdomains/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Setting up Subdomain</a>. The directory is optional. If you are using a sub-domain, you may not need to use a sub-directory. You can learn more by reading <a href="https://stateu.org/docs/uncategorized/subdomains-vs-subdirectories/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Subdomains vs Subdirectories</a>.

-Under <strong>version</strong>, select the version that is most recent.
-By default the installer will automatically backup your website and update it anytime a new version comes out. While we recommend you keep this option, it is possible to only do minor updates, or turn them off completely.
-The installer will also create a database for you automatically, but if you’ve already created one for this website you can choose <strong>Let me manage the database settings</strong> and enter the details.

-Finally, in Settings, you’ll need to create a username and password for the Scalar install. A password can be generated for you, but you should try to create your own.</li>
 	<li class="vspace">Click<strong> Install</strong>.</li>
 	<li class="vspace">Once the installer is finished loading, you will be taken to the <strong>My Apps</strong> section of the dashboard. Here you'll find links to login to your scalar installation.
