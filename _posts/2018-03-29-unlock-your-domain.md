This article only if you own your own top-level domain. If you have been using the free subdomain option with stateu.org through State University, this does <strong>not</strong> apply to you.

Similarly, if you're <a href="https://stateu.org/docs/uncategorized/migrate-to-reclaim-hosting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">migrating your content to Reclaim Hosting</a>, this article does <strong>not</strong> apply to you.

Transferring a domain you already own is not too much different from registering a new domain, except the transfer process requires an <strong>EPP code</strong>, or an agreement code between your old registrar and your new registrar that allows the release of your domain. Your new registrar will have information on how to transfer in a domain. When you start that process, you will be prompted to enter your EPP code.

<strong>How to find your EPP Code</strong>:
<ol>
 	<li class="vspace">To get started you'll need to login to your control panel (<a class="urlextern" title="https://stateu.org/dashboard" href="https://stateu.org/dashboard" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://stateu.org/dashboard</a>) using your StateU username and password.

 	<li class="vspace">Once you’re logged in, you’ll see the cPanel interface.  Now click on the <strong>Manage Your Account</strong> menu at the top of your screen and select <strong>Migration Information</strong>.

</ol>
3. Click the <strong>Lock</strong> button to unlock your State University account.

4. Click <strong>Get Code</strong>. Once that's done, the system will send you an email with your EPP code.

At this stage, here are a few items to note:
<ul>
 	<li>You'll receive a series of emails from both your old and new registrars asking you to authorize the transfer. Please act on <em>every</em> email you receive in a timely fashion-- even if the emails look like duplicates.</li>
 	<li>If you do not authorize the transfer in a timely fashion, the domain transfer will expire and you will need to start over.</li>
 	<li>The domain must be older than 60 days.</li>
 	<li>The domain must have no other transfers in the last 60 days.</li>
 	<li>The domain transfer process can take up to a week, depending on how fast your registrars work.</li>
 	<li>Once the domain transfer completes, you'll receive a notification.</li>
</ul>
