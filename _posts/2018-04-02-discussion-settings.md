What makes WordPress a powerful platform is that not only can you create a dynamic website, but you can also allow dynamic discussions about the content with your visitors. Comments, the bread and butter of the discussion, can add to the overhead of your website management. You have to keep up with responses to your commenters or they will think you aren't paying attention. Comments also can come, unfortunately, in the form of Spam. We will give you some additional information about dealing with Spam in another section. For now, here's how to manage your Discussion Settings.
<ol>
 	<li class="vspace">Start at the <strong>Dashboard</strong>.<img class="shadow alignnone wp-image-153 size-full" src="https://stateu.org/docs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019104.1-f.gif" alt="Screen shot of Wordpress Dashboard" width="1245" height="1085" /></li>
 	<li class="vspace">Navigate to <strong>Settings &gt; Discussion</strong>.<img class="shadow alignnone wp-image-287 size-full" src="https://stateu.org/docs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019104.1-discussion-default-article-settings.gif" alt="screen shot of discussion settings, part 1" width="1175" height="939" />
<ul>
 	<li>The two main forms of discussion on a website are “Allow link notifications from other blogs (pingbacks and trackbacks)” and “Allow people to post comments on new articles”.</li>
 	<li>Comments are self-explanatory. People come to your website, read an article, and as long as you allow comments, people can write whatever is on their mind. Commenters must leave their name and email address (if you leave that setting checked). You can also require users to be registered to your site to comment. They would then need to be logged in to submit any comments. By default, you will get an email sent to the admin account of the WordPress site when someone posts a comment, or when a comment is held in moderation. You can uncheck those boxes if you do not wish to receive those emails.</li>
 	<li>A comment will appear on the article (post or page) only after you approve it. If you have approved a comment author once, they will be automatically approved the next time they leave a comment on your site. If you uncheck the box labeled “Comment author must have a previously approved comment”, then all comments will appear automatically. <strong>We don't recommend this setting</strong>.</li>
 	<li>You also have some control over comment moderation regarding how many links a comment contains (spammers like to put links in their “comments”). You also can filter out words, URLs, email addresses, to hold them in moderation. You can then approve them, spam them, or trash them.</li>
 	<li>There are also forms of discussion called link notifications. Spammers like these too. Here's an article on the <a class="urlextern" title="http://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/what-why-and-how-tos-of-trackbacks-and-pingbacks-in-wordpress/" href="http://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/what-why-and-how-tos-of-trackbacks-and-pingbacks-in-wordpress/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">What, Why, and How-To’s of Trackbacks and Pingbacks in WordPress</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li class="vspace">Sometimes it's nice to have visual representations of the people who are commenting on your blog. These are called <strong>Avatars</strong> and can be found under <strong>Settings &gt; Discussion</strong>.<img class="shadow alignnone wp-image-285 size-full" src="https://stateu.org/docs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019104.1-discussion-avatar-settings.gif" alt="screen shot of discussion settings, part 2" width="1186" height="957" /></li>
</ol>
WordPress uses a common universal system of avatars called <a class="urlextern" title="http://gravatar.com/" href="http://gravatar.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Gravatars</a> (Globally Recognized Avatars). The system requires you to sign up with your email address. You can upload a graphical representation of yourself (a picture or other graphic). From then on you are identified with your Gravatar on any blog that you use that email address with.

In the WordPress Discussion Settings, you have a few options. Whether to show Avatars at all, the “rating” allowed to be shown, and what the default Avatar will be if a user does not have a Gravatar.
