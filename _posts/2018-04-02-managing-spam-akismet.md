SPAM! Everyone hates it in their email. If you're new to WordPress and blogging platforms, spam exists in the form of comment spam - people (or vermin) leave comments promoting their services or schemes, on a post or page.

So how do you deal with comment spam when it can come in even more often than email spam? Do you have to delete every comment that comes in? Well, the answer to the second question is “no”, and the answer to the first question is, with a plugin called <a class="urlextern" title="http://akismet.com/" href="http://akismet.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Akismet</a>.
<ol>
 	<li class="vspace">To get started we need to install a plugin. To do this, we'll start at the <strong>Dashboard</strong>.<img class="shadow alignnone wp-image-153 size-full" src="https://stateu.org/docs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019104.1-f.gif" alt="Screen shot of Wordpress Dashboard" width="1245" height="1085" /></li>
 	<li class="vspace">Navigate to <strong>Plugins &gt; Installed Plugins</strong>.<img class="shadow alignnone wp-image-166 size-full" src="https://stateu.org/docs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019104.1-q.gif" alt="Screen shot of Akismet on plugins menu" width="1226" height="709" /></li>
 	<li class="vspace">At or near the top of the list of plugins that are automatically installed in a new WordPress installation, is <a class="urlextern" title="http://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Akismet</a>. It is not activated, so part of the process of getting Akismet is <strong>Activating</strong> the plugin. Before you activate it, however, you need to get something that will be somewhat strange for most people. It's called an <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> key. <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> stands for Application Programming Interface, and it's a way for programs and services to “talk” to each other. The Akismet plugin requires you to get an <strong>Akismet <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Key</strong>, which is simply a “code” that you supply when activating the plugin. The key is free if you use it on a personal WordPress installation, and it's <a class="urlextern" title="http://akismet.com/wordpress/" href="http://akismet.com/wordpress/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">available on the Akismet website</a>.<img class="shadow alignnone wp-image-167 size-full" src="https://stateu.org/docs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019104.1-r.gif" alt="screen shot after activating Akismet" width="1226" height="801" /></li>
 	<li class="vspace">Once you arrive on the Akismet for WordPress site, click the <strong>Get an Akismet <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> key</strong> button.<img class="shadow alignnone wp-image-168 size-full" src="https://stateu.org/docs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019104.1-s.gif" alt="Screen shot of Akismet web site where you get key" width="1055" height="1037" /></li>
 	<li class="vspace">If you have an account at <a class="urlextern" title="http://wordpress.com/" href="http://wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">WordPress.com</a> you can sign in with that login and get your key. Otherwise, fill in an email address, a username, and a password to use for a new account. Click the <strong>Sign up</strong> button to proceed.
<img class="shadow alignnone wp-image-169 size-full" src="https://stateu.org/docs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019104.1-t.gif" alt="create a wordpress.com account, if you don't already have one" width="1055" height="1005" /></li>
 	<li class="vspace">Type in the <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> of the site you'll use Akismet on and click on the <strong>Sign Up</strong> button under the Personal plan (that is if you want it to be the free version).<img class="shadow alignnone wp-image-294 size-full" src="https://stateu.org/docs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019104.1-v.gif" alt="Select desired Akismet plan" width="1055" height="1005" /></li>
 	<li class="vspace">When you get to the next page, the recommended contribution is $36. You can adjust the slider down to $0. The smiley face will begin to frown, but at least your key will be free. Lastly, fill in your name and click <strong>Continue</strong>.
<img class="shadow alignnone wp-image-293 size-full" src="https://stateu.org/docs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019104.1-w.gif" alt="" width="1055" height="1005" /></li>
 	<li class="vspace">You're finished with the sign-up process for your key, and it will be displayed on the page for you (we've blurred ours out).<img class="shadow alignnone wp-image-289 size-full" src="https://stateu.org/docs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019104.1-x.gif" alt="Akismet key" width="1055" height="1005" /></li>
 	<li class="vspace">Now follow the steps that they show you for using your new key. You will enter the key in either the Akismet area under Plugins or JetPack (if you have that installed).<img class="shadow alignnone wp-image-291 size-full" src="https://stateu.org/docs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019104.1-z.gif" alt="Akismet key" width="1226" height="567" /></li>
