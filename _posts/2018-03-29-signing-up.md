<h1>Review the Guidelines</h1>
Before you get started, we recommend that you review our information about <a class="wikilink1" title="general:choosing-a-domain-name" href="http://stateu.org/docs/uncategorized/choosing-your-domain-name/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Choosing a Domain Name</a>.
<h1>The Sign-Up Process</h1>
Once you've reviewed the guidelines, you can proceed to the <a class="urlextern" title="https://stateu.org" href="https://stateu.org" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">sign-up page.</a>
<ol>
 	<li class="vspace">Click the "Get Started" Button

 	<li class="vspace">You are now ready to create a domain. To start, you must first sign up for a free subdomain (i.e. yoursite.stateu.org). Directions for purchasing a Top Level Domain (i.e. yourdomain.com) will be provided further down.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-340" src="https://stateu.org/docs/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/stateu-e1522415387120-1.png" alt="" width="767" height="227" /></p>

<h2 id="option-1free-subdomain" class="sectionedit4">Option 1: Free Subdomain</h2>
For no cost, you can create a subdomain of stateu.org.

To create a free subdomain of stateu.org, leave this default option selected and enter the subdomain name you want for your website. When you’ve found an available subdomain, click the button labeled "Continue."
<div class="level3">

Confirm that you like the name you selected. If you do, click the "signup" button. (If not, click the "start over" button, and repeat the above step.)

<h2 id="option-1free-subdomain" class="sectionedit4">Option 2: Buy a top-level domain from Reclaim Hosting</h2>
It is easy to create your own top-level domain. This allows you to select a URL for your website that is easy to remember and share.

While you are at State University, this is available for a nominal cost (currently $15/year). You can continue to use this domain after leaving StateU, although the cost may increase.

To register a top-level domain log into your newly created cPanel, navigate to the Domains section, and click <strong>Register Top-Level Domain</strong>.

This panel offers a step-by-step guide to registering and adding a new top-level domain to your new cPanel account.
<h2 id="option-1free-subdomain" class="sectionedit4">Option 3: Connect an existing domain to your cPanel</h2>
If you already have an existing domain that you've previously registered elsewhere, simply point your domain's nameservers to <strong>ns1.reclaimhosting.com</strong> and <strong>ns2.reclaimhosting.com</strong>.
