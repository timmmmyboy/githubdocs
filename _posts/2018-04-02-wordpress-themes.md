When it comes to WordPress, customizing the look of your site is simple and straightforward. When you install WordPress, the default (or pre-set) theme is called <strong>Twenty Seventeen</strong> (as of WordPress version 4.8). It is a very customizable theme.

You can find <a class="urlextern" title="http://wordpress.org/support/theme/twentyfourteen" href="https://wordpress.org/themes/twentyseventeen/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">general information about Twenty Seventeen here</a>.

In addition to Twenty Seventeen, you'll have other themes available to you. (What themes you have depends upon if you did a default WordPress installation, or if you installed a special package.) If Twenty Seventeen doesn't meet your needs, you can activate another theme on your site or install a completely new one.

That's all you need to do to change the look of your site with a new theme.

If none of the themes that were provided when you installed WordPress are what you're looking for, you can always search for and install other themes from the WordPress Theme Repository.
<ol>
 	<li class="vspace">Navigate to <strong>Appearance &gt; Themes</strong>.

 	<li class="vspace">Installing new themes is quite simple. You start by going to the <strong>Add New</strong> Button.

 	<li class="vspace">The initial page is the Search Theme page, and it's not visually helpful. You can check a few filter boxes to see what comes up, but there is a more visual way. Click the <strong>Featured</strong> link at the top and you'll get visual (screenshot) examples of other themes you can install. You can also click <strong>Newest</strong> or <strong>Recently Updated</strong>.</li>
 	<li class="vspace">Under the thumbnail picture of each theme (when you hover your mouse over the theme) are three choices - <strong>Install</strong>, <strong>Preview</strong>, and <strong>Details &amp; Preview</strong>. Those choices should be pretty self-explanatory so click <strong>Install</strong> to add a new theme to your site.

 	<li class="vspace">After you install the theme, it is still not active on your site. You will need to <strong>Activate</strong> it to use it.

</ol>
Once activated, your site will be using the new theme. Visit your site's homepage to view your new theme.
