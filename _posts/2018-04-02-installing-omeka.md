To get started you'll need to login to your control panel (<a class="urlextern" title="https://stateu.org/dashboard" href="https://stateu.org/dashboard" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://stateu.org/dashboard</a>) using your State University username and password.
<ol>
 	<li class="vspace">Once logged in you'll be on the homepage of your cPanel. Navigate to the <strong>Web Applications</strong> section of the cPanel and find <strong>Featured Applications</strong>. Then select <strong>Omeka</strong>.

 	<li class="vspace">This page gives you more information about the Omeka software. To begin the install, click <strong>install this application</strong> in the upper-righthand corner.

 	<li class="vspace">On the next page, the installer will ask for some information about this install. The first thing you'll want to do is decide where to install it. If you're wanting to install Omeka on your main domain, you can leave the directory area empty. If you created a subdomain, you can select it from the drop-down menu. You also have the option of installing Omeka in a subfolder by typing in the folder name in the <strong>Directory </strong>field. Click here for more information about <a class="urlextern" title="https://stateu.org/support/cpanel/subdomains-vs-subfolders" href="https://stateu.org/docs/uncategorized/subdomains-vs-subdirectories/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">subdomains and subfolders</a>.

 	<li class="vspace">Scroll down to the next Setting section. Set an Administrator Username and Administrator Password. You will need this again shortly.</li>
 	<li class="vspace">By default the installer will automatically backup your website and update it anytime a new version comes out. While we recommend you keep this option, it is possible to only do minor updates, or turn them off completely. The installer will also create a database for you automatically, but if you've already created one for this website you can choose <strong>Let me manage the database settings</strong> and enter the details. Click <strong>Install</strong> to continue.

 	<li class="vspace">The installer will take just a few moments to install Omeka and a progress bar will keep you updated. When it is complete you will see a link to your new Omeka site as well as a link to the backend administrative section for your Omeka site. Click the <strong>Omeka Admin</strong> link to configure your new Omeka installation.

 	<li class="vspace">When you visit your new Omeka Admin link, you are asked for the admin username and password. Enter the <strong>Username </strong>and <strong>Password</strong> that you set for the administrative superuser (i.e. yourself).
